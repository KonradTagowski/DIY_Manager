# DIY_Manager
The project goal is to create an easily modified platform to manage my DIY projects, such as a smart electronic component organizer, WiFi multi-sensor meter, etc.

The platform will be available on a mobile phone app (React Native) or by an internet browser (server hosted by local Raspberry Pi).

Tech stack: Flask, Javascript, HTML, CSS, React Native. 

The service will be available only in the local network. 

Planned supported DIY devices:
- SECO - Smart Electronic Component Organizer
- WiFi multi-sensor meter
- more in the future...
